# Welcome to _loving impulse_

Thank you for stopping by loving impulse. I'm grateful you're here. This is a blog about my journey to that place of peace and stillness that resides inside each of us. We're told life is about balance, yet I find myself feeling a fleeting moment of balance that took me lots of focused, disciplined effort to create, only to have it disappear instantly. I'm sharing my journey to help myself and others feel less alone. 

Buddha Nature is our inherent quality of peace, oneness, and wholeness. Buddha Nature means we came into this world having all the wisdom and unlimited love we'll ever need. To be exact, we are perfect--all we need is to realize it. Strip away all of our stories, self-doubt, addictions, suffering, distractions, worries, triggers, etc, etc, and you have a pure gem of unconditional love, kindness, and compassion. The catch? You gotta strip down. 

_loving impulse_ is my little piece of Buddha Nature. I've noticed that I have this initial impulse to be kind and helpful in the moment when I interact with others, yet sometimes I don't act on it. I stuff it down and keep it to myself. A few years ago, I noticed when I purposefully act on this _loving impluse_, I instantly felt better and more energetic and so did the person/people I interacted with. I've started to act on my _loving impulse_ but realized it takes effort to be in that space consistently. 

In this blog, along with stories of acting on the _loving impulse_, you will find strategies, tools, and techniques that I've found helpful in supporting our inherent kindness. It's not about me having all the answers, it's about suggesting things I've found helpful so that you can give it a try for yourself and decide. 

Here's a quick road map of what to expect on _loving impulse_: 

* act -- a page dedicated to stories where I've acted on the _loving impulse_
* breathe -- blog posts related to meditation, breathwork, slowing down
* eat -- posts about food, eating, recipes, binge eating, restaurants I found from doing instagram recon
* move -- a page about workouts, hiking, yoga, not working out (you get the idea)
* simplify -- blog posts about living a simpler life, products that are my       go-tos, how to simplify and why

I hope this space is as supportive for you as it is for me. As our world gets faster and crazier, it's time to turn within for wisdom instead of looking externally for answers.
